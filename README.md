# neural-network-challenge-1

Creating classification models and evaluating accuracy of spam detection

## Description

Uses previous student loan recipients to develope a model to predict the likelihood that an applicant will repay their student loans. Applies understanding of neural networks to develop a more accurate load repayment prediction model and more accurate interest rates for borrowers 


### Skills Demonstrated

The primary skills demonstrated include the ability to:
* Prepare data for neural network model use
* Compile and evaluate a prediction model using neural network
* Create, train, and evaluate neural network models using TensorFlow
* Use KerasTuner to assist with finding optimal neural network structures
* Save trained TensorFlow models for later use

### Dependencies

Python Libraries and Functions
* pandas
* pathlib
* tensorflow
* Dense (from tensorflow.keras.layers)
* Sequential (from tensorflow.keras.models)
* train_test_split (from klearn.model_selection)
* classification_report (from sklearn.metrics)
* StandardScaler (from sklearn.preprocessing)
